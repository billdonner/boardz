These are my setups for my various Midi Keyboards in Apple Mainstage 3. I'm trying real hard to keep them as similar as possible. 
## Arturia 88 
I use this keyboard with planB where I need a bunch of special patches for horns, strings for Abbey Road songs, but otherwise just pianos,rhodes, wurli, and various b3 organs. It has 2x9 faders, 2x9 knobs, 4x4 pads/buttons, and 5is other useful buttons
## Akai Advance 61
I dont use any of the Akai VIP software, which is pretty good, but hard to maintain. Instead, it is just general purpose keyboard with 8 knobs, 12 useful buttons, and (virtual 4 x) 8 pad buttons
## Nord Stage Midi @UB's House
The nord plays fine thru the arturia setup, but really doesnt have any knobs, buttons faders so Aka MDP Pad device is utlitized
